# MLEXIDE


### Deploying Code
*This step describes how to deploy your Roxy application into your MarkLogic Server modules database. If you have elected to run your code locally out of the filesystem you do not need to do this.*

1. Open a command prompt in the root folder of Roxy
2. `$ ml local deploy modules`

### Congratulations
**Congratulations!** You have MLExide running on your server. Now you need to start customizing it.
